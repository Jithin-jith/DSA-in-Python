# RECURSION

> Recursion is a way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself.

## Properties of Recursion

- Perform the same operation multiple times with different inputs.
- Successive steps have smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
- Recursion should have a termination condition, or else it will result in an infinite loop.

## WHY RECURSION?

> Recursive thinking is important in programming as it helps you break down big problems into smaller ones and makes them easier to solve.

## WHEN TO USE RECURSION?

- Recursion can be used when a problem can be divided into similar and smaller sub-problems.
- Recursion is prominently used when dealing with data structures like trees and graphs.
- Recursion is used in many algorithms like Divide and Conquer, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming.
- When we need a quick working solution instead of an efficient one.
- When we need memoization (top-down approach).

## WHEN TO NOT USE RECURSION

- If time and space complexity matters.
- If we need memory-efficient programs.

## STACK MEMORY

> Stack memory is used by the system for managing recursive calls.
